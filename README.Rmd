# About

Making maps with R has been quite easy due to various [packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html). For example, the `maps` package has a function that directly plots US counties:

```{r maps-county, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(maps)
map("county")
```

Or use the above data but plot it with `ggplot2`:

```{r ggplot-county, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
map_data("county") -> map_data_county
ggplot() +
  geom_map(data = map_data_county, map = map_data_county,
           aes(x = long, y = lat, map_id = region),
           color="black", fill="white", size=0.1)
```

Or with `ggcounty`:

```{r ggcouty, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggcounty)
ggcounty.us() -> us
us$gg
```

The problem with these maps, however, is that Alaska and Hawaii are often missing. Moving these two states into a US map involves rotating, shrinking, and shifting the corresponding spatial polygons.

The `usmapdata` package intends to solve this problem by providing tidy data frames that have Alaska and Hawaii in proper place, following the procedure documented nicely in [a blog post by Bob Rudis](rud.is/b/2014/11/16/moving-the-earth-well-alaska-hawaii-with-r/).
